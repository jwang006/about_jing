                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">
                    The inspiration for this project derives from a natural phenomenon during the huge flood disaster in Pakistan in 2010 (P1): Spiders, in their bid to evade the floods, took to the trees to spin webs for survival and reproduction. Through investigation, it was discovered that this self-preservation behavior of spiders, to some extent, proved beneficial to humanity. 
                    Like humans, while awaiting the receding floods, spiders, as generalist predators, preyed on mosquitos, thus reducing the transmission of malaria and significantly lowering the mortality rate . It's astonishing how self-sustaining ecosystems are, yet it always has sparked some doubts: "Burn them with fire." Initially incomprehensible, this, indeed, perfectly embodies "survival of the fittest.
                    " Darwin's theory remains unchallenged, but humanitarianism can sometimes seem rather selfish.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    When disasters come, spiders, as a part of nature, fulfill their roles and duties, safeguarding and serving other life forms, thereby maintaining the equilibrium of the natural ecosystem. As a designer and artist, also a part of nature,
                     I wish to, in my own way, extend care and concern to non-human beings - spiders and other species.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                     In the theory of the natural cycle, everything is interconnected. Although spiders were beneficial to humanity, they destroyed trees (P3). Perhaps burning them is one circle way, but I believe that creating a habitat suitable for spider survival is a win-win virtuous cycle.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    This is an art practice that doesn't neglect the needs of creatures beyond humans. 
                    The design employs cellular automaton algorithms to simulate such a complex world order and natural phenomenon, thereby establishing new modes of coexistence between the natural society and human society.

                <!-- <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                    <p align="justify">Spiderland is an artifact based on weather API from Pakistan in 2010 and cellular automaton algorithms. 
                        The behavior of spiders in floods is influenced by extreme weather fluctuations. 
                        Initially, a series of changes in humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and other factors associated with flood weather affect spider “balloons”  (P2), as well as the stickiness, weight, and flight height of spider silk. Additionally, the gaps between tree trunks provide an ideal space for spiders. 
                        My growth logic of the cellular automaton algorithm, based on these conditions and the behavior of spiders, generates a space suitable for spider growth. 
                    </p>

                    <p align="justify">  
                        This sculpture primarily utilizes Python in Blender and the geometry node and is divided into three steps, data processing, vertex generation, and the conversion of points to surfaces. 
                        First, followed the tutorial from Erindale, extruding the data I needed from the JSON file and the data transformation(P1). 
                        Then, unlike other cellular automata, after asking Chatgpt, I established multiple cells with six attributes, including humidity, temperature, rainfall, and so on, and set two conditionals performed to assign x, y, and z coordinates to each cell. 
                        The first set of conditions determined cell coordinates based on the data threshold. Whether there was rain or not was another crucial factor in determining the specific model shape. 
                        About conversion of points to surfaces.  
                        I used volume mesh and morphing meshes with Geometry Nodes, learned from Entagma and Khamurai.  
                        Tessellate, learned from Alessandro, was the primary tool I used for surface and detailed design. 
                        I deconstructed a cube (P3), according to the environmental conditions for building spider webs like tree trunks and corners, and applied it to the generated surface using quad mode. 
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        In preparation for the "sim-bio-sys" exhibition, I created an animated video to assist viewers in understanding the design process, following Zhicheng's suggestion. 
                        In this video, I used Python to generate API data visualizations and used Blender animations to showcase the entire model generation process, learned from BlenderMania. 
                        Additionally, 3D printing and unconventional water tanks were used to simulate flood scenes and demonstrate the practical applications of the model.

                <p align="justify">
                    This project represents the combination of my undergraduate background with a computation art. 
                    Besides, microorganisms have always been a personal passion of mine. Over more than two months process, this project has yielded significant gains in coding skills during the exploration process. 
                    This includes learning about algorithms, Python, Blender add-ons, animation, and rendering techniques. Moreover, the development of a logical and rigorous design are also valuable insights I've gained. 
                    The relationship between weather data and spider behavior, as well as the connection between cellular automaton algorithms and spider societies, required careful consideration. 
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    On the other hand, I realize the importance of effective communication during exhibitions. 
                    In contrast to the direct sensory experience of interactive artworks, graphical information, and more analytical charts may be the primary means of presenting my sculptural work.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Moving forward, I am contemplating observational experiments with spiders to assess the feasibility and practicality of Spiderland. 
                    Additionally, I am considering exploring real-time data for generative art. Beyond floods, I've discovered that this phenomenon also occurs along the banks of streams and in mountainous shrubbery. 
                    Different data sets, such as terrain and altitude, create distinct wonderlands for spiders. That makes me feel excited.
