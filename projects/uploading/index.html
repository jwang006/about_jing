                <p align="justify">This project investigates the relationship between the environment and cognition in humans. 
                    This is aimed to show the link between associations and recollections of reality and memorized environments. 
                    This project extracted details, colors, or outlines from photographs of the present and past surroundings, to weave an image of a memory network by recollection or imagination.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
            
                <p align="justify">Urban is iterating, the population is migrating, the world is diversifying, and our living environment is gradually becoming the same---globalization. 
                    The spiritual world is quite essential due to the lack of a sense of belonging to a place. 
                    Christian Norberg-Schulz also points out that 'GENIUS LOCI' is the objectification and spatialization of one's memory, sense of identity, and sense of belonging to a location. 
                    For instance, seeing Asda in other cities will make me less uncomfortable in an unfamiliar environment, simply because there is one right in front of my flat.
                </p> 


                <p align="justify"> Memory space represents an individual's sense of belonging to the existing space. 
                    It is the cognitive re-creation of the realistic environment through personal experience and memory. 
                    According to Turner, "it is through creating, remembering, and connecting similar stories that humans can travel around the world and make sense of a vast array of events and processes." 
                    In other words, human consciousness can travel through different environments. Just like <em>Avatar</em> , humans such as Jack become Na'vi with a consciousness link and they can travel back and forth between the human and Pandora worlds. 
                    Our brain learns and remembers and creates new spaces by retrieving and associating memory spaces through existing physical spaces as references. 
                    Tulving attributes this process to the hippocampus." The "3W" question, "when", "where" and "what", is the basis of the hippocampus' ability to remember, and has been demonstrated in many experiments.

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
              
                <p align="justify">
                    As in the Avatar films, humans such as Jack become Na'vi with a consciousness link and travel back and forth between the human and Pandora worlds.
                    This work attempts to show how the “hippocampus” works, and to produce a new 'memory environment'. 
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    I divided design process into three steps. The first step is the extraction of information from the environment. 
                    The images photted from UK and Nanjing which is my hometown. They were used as input and as a reference to each other. 
                   
                </p>
               


                <p align="justify">
                The second part was called searching, based on the '3W' theory. According to Kevin Lynch's 'five elements' mentioned in <em>The Image of the City</em>, I tried to pick up colors and outlines through pixel and blob algorithms to create my "Imaginable" spaces. 
                The last step is the key point referred to as 'uploading'. This process bridges the gap between these two places, which spans a time difference of nine hours and 9,400 km. 
                Like the 'map overlay method', those details extracted from the image are reorganized or merged together as tiles and output pictures of the memory space.

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p align="justify">Uploading and downloading are vital parts of this process to ensure that the computer is constantly running. 
                    There are probably many forms of interaction in this project. 
                    For example, it could allow participants to upload and select upload methods for their environmental space photos, which could create a grand database of memorised images.
                </p>

                <p align="justify">At the same time, the project takes its surroundings as a starting point and attempts to implement in code the mechanisms by which natural creatures operate. 
                    These natural creatures and computer outputs are out of human control, yet mysterious and beautiful. 
                    It is an attempt to combine computer-generated art with nature and the environment. 
                    After further study, I will commit to simulating those processes with the help of machine learning and mathematical and algorithmic techniques, even more, amazing things will happen, I am convinced.
