                <!-- <p align="justify">"Flow" is the relationship between human behavior and the environment. 
                    This project uses color tracking to interact with the participants, and create physical trails of movement, and generative 'flow' trails. 
                    Those trails are a path of human behavior and the results leave behind that behavior.</p> -->

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">Humans always enjoy disciplining our environment. We specialize in modifying the natural environment, placing it in a way that is adapted to human survivalism and behaviors. 
                    Around the world, we plan roads, regulate planting areas, guide traffic with lights, view the landscape from the plenty of small windows of skyscrapers, and so on. 
                    Even this "hobby" has developed beyond the surface of the planet. Musk's plans for the transformation of Mars were great and futuristic,for instance.
                    Also, Cixin Liu emphasizes the importance of transforming the universe in <em>One and One Hundred Thousand Earth</em>.</p>
                
                    <p align="justify">
                        Unlike nature, which is mysterious and disorderly. Flowing water, it relies on its environment to change its shape,for instance. 
                        
                        In my point of view, the development and survival of the "flow" of civilization in human society is dependent on the earth and nature. 
                        The "flow" is invisible, but at the same time dependent on the "form", is carried by people or objects, has time and space, and changes over time with each frame changes in the three dimensions of space. 
                        Hong Wang mentioned that "flow" (flow, flux, circulation) is the essence of natural and social development. 
                        Castells M also proposes that flow space is "the material organization of social practices that operate through flow and share time". 
                        This "flow" of space has evolved with the times, and the context always changed with the trails, which has eventually been preserved in some form of material. </p>

                    was start from a bool judgment: if ( addition == subtraction). 
                    Subtractions are created by addition. For instance, cookie and cookie cutter. Masks emerged because of lots of overlapping.
                    In additon, Colours, sizes, directions, and quantities are elements to make addition and subtraction to create art including paper cutting, sculptures, architecture...

                <p align="justify">Refection:</em>
                    After a quick pop-up, I recognized the possibilities of the material. 
                    The combination of ink and black cardboard, with variations in light and angle, was very unexpected. 
                    The overlay is not only seen in graphic changes but can also be material. 
                    Addition and subtraction between different materials intrigued me a lot. 
                    The properties of paper, and transparency, and successfully change the traditional mode of reading, also rich visual effects.
                    On the other hand, I appreciate those compliments my colleagues gave. They shared their views from different perspectives and inspired me a lot. For instance, "It looks like the moon". "It's kind of viruses?" And so on...
                </p>

                    was start from a bool judgment: if ( addition == subtraction). 
                    Subtractions are created by addition. For instance, cookie and cookie cutter. Masks emerged because of lots of overlapping.

                </p>
        
                <p align="justify">The impact of human behavior on the environment is inevitable and its trials are well documented, including the construction of cities, as well as the damage to the soil, all of which needs time. 
                    This work was based on the character of "flow", both time and space, to create a time-delayed texture, which is a metaphor for the relationship between the environment and human behavior. 
                    </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Firstly, the spatiality of 'Flow' is reflected in the movement of particles which was a continuation of circles from MVP project</em>. 
                    Also, the flowing effect of the ink reflections learned from quickly pop-up show. 
                    This time attempted to design flowing particles moving in a 3D instead of 2D. 
                    Particles expanded and regrouped in force and velocity resulting from the distance between lights, and then created a repeated contraction and expansion like a flow of light.
                
                </p>
                        
                <p align="justify">Secondly, the time of the "flow" is reflected in the material.  
                    I believe that the trials of behavior should be permanently and enriched variably over time. 
                    I used UV-changed paper to display these trails. 
                    And also tested a lot about light, material, and performance.

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">The pop-up was successful and I appreciate those compliments. 
                    Through the interaction with the UV light and paper, the viewer successfully noticed the traces of the flow and questioned how it works with their movement, which is the key and purpose of this project.
                    What's more, time is perhaps the next stage I need to update. Chinese sculptor Jianguo Sui, in his<em>The Shape of Time</em>, visualizes time. 
                    Sam Lavigne's <em>Unwhorl</em> gives snails the power to be musicians, which is interesting.
                    I believe that the trials of behavior should be permanently and enriched variably over time. 
                    It could be either gradually growing paint or a translation of the snail's behavior. 
                    Besides, informative cues of the project need to be improved too during the exhibition. 
                    Some viewers did not how to interact with my project without my explanation.
                </p>
                        
                <p align="justify">Secondly, the time of the "flow" is reflected in the material. As Kyra Schmidt demonstrates in her <em>Transcriptions</em>, the environment is visual, material, and temporal. 
                    In her work, the colors change through the seasons, from sunrise to sunset. That inspired me to use UV-changed paper to display these trails. 
                    Also, I need to think about how to show those traces and behaviors at the same time.</p>
