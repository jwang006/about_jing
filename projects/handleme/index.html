                <p align="justify">HandleMe is an interactive installation that allows to control your life with your fingers. 
                    I want to illustrate the conflicting link between personal freedom and the unpredictability of external factors in a funny way. 
                    Through their fingers, the viewer controls the life and actions of 'I' in the flat. 
                    While exercising and entertaining rights, I hope to make viewers consider the relationship between rights and individuals.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">Random delights and concerns me since it is everything, both good and horrible. In Willian Kentridge's <em> Waiting for Sibyl </em> he contrasts random to hope. The wind scatters the sibyl 's prophesy, and the fated prophecy becomes a chance event. The only difference between good and bad fortune is one's decision.
                    But reality isn't always like that; it's "pseudo-random" and has a threshold. Individual freedom is usually placed in the social order, and individual freedom is dependent on not crossing legal and moral bounds. This pseudo-randomness of freedom is described by Foucault as a generalisation of the 'power effect'.
                    This suggests that the border of rights is the threshold of freedom, which is similar to RandomSeed being the order and norm of the random series between. I attempted to explain this amusing interdependence in an interactive format.
                    </p>
                <p align="justify">This research investigates the boundary between freedom and the capacity to regulate rights through randomness and uncertainty. I attempt to build my life's independence on the strength of the exterior. Due to randomness and uncertainty, I try to create my independence in life on the strength of my appearance. It is a two-way randomseed, with the controlling party having no influence over the content of'my' activities in a confined region, and the 'I' having no control over'my' actions. 
                    The control party has no say in what the 'I' does in the limited region, and the 'I' has no say in what the 'I' does. </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">"Handleme" is an abstract interpretation of "my" life, revealing the "possibilities" of "my" freedom. 
                    Because of the size of ssd1306  is tiny, plastic magnifier(p1) was my first choice, and so the installation shape was designed in 3d, such as folding space (p2/p3). 
                    However, due to challenges with the material's cutting, I decided to use layout plan (p4). I calculated the duration and frequency of my activities in the room and divided it into three scenes: showering, walking, and studying/playing. 
                    The kinematic map is connected between the three scenes. The viewer connects with the Arduino in real time using the p5js Web Camera and serial. With continuous conditions, p5js' hand Post, which determines finger bending, controls the multi-screen interactive displays. 
                    The interactive is intended to provide "index finger power" and "invisible control."</p>

                <img src="./assets/images/techni.png"/>

                    <p align="justify">The pictures on the four SSD 1306 OLEDs are customised with symbols and dynamic effects to preview my everyday routine. 
                        No.1 - showering, the "x" denotes a non-rude expression. 
                        No.2 and No.3 - while walking, the viewer's hand pushes the little ball from side to side. 
                        No.4 - learning/entertainment section, bouncing balls clash throughout the space. </p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p align="justify">Bouncing Ball displayed in No. 4 is a dramatic depiction of the project's creation process. 
                    The good news is that the outcome is ideal. To enhance realism and intrigue, first attempts were made to replicate the physical environment using p5.play and matter.js. 
                    However, I was unable to resolve the communication issues with Arduino. As a result, rather than having items move like a magic hand, a symbolic animated story in the form of a display was chosen. 
                    For now, the abstract animation fits the playful spirit of the engagement.The gap between displays was caused by my excessive schedule, which did not give enough time for testing and reprinting.</p>
                <p align="justify">I invited a friend to examine my artwork, and her reaction was exactly what I expected: she was dissatisfied with having control over her present behaviors. 
                    She envisioned discovering the bounds of power through a variety of hand postures. 
                    This made sense to me, but the interaction's user experience may be needed to improve I suppose.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/images/hand.png"/>
                <p align="justify">As someone with a background in spatial design, this is my attempt to integrate space with interactivity. 
                    Space, interaction, and narrative are all intriguing to me. 
                    In the future, I might consider ways of interaction that that focus on narrative design to enrich the viewer's actual experience. 
                    At the same time, I consider portraying the experiences of freedom in a way that is general rather than exclusive to myself. 
                    In addition, I will also take a rigorous approach to analysis interior such as  Heatmap.</p>
